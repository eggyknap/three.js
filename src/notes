* Create slave HTML page that includes three.js, three-lg.js, socket.io, and
  the rendering container, and simply calls THREE.lg_init('appname', undefined,
  undefined, undefined, undefined, false);
* Create the initialScene function, to add all the meshes, etc. for the first
  rendering

* Modify preRender functions to capture anything that should update between
  renderings, and apply it on the slave
